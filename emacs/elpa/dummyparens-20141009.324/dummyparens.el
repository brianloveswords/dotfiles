;;; Commentary:

;; Dummyparens is a simple utility providing parentheses auto-pairing and
;; wrapping.

;; When you press an opening parenthesis key it inserts the closing one
;; for you. If a region is selected when you press the key, the region
;; will be wrapped. If you wrap with { it will also indent the wrapped
;; region (convenient for C and the like).

;; This is similar to electric-pair minor mode, but with wrapping.

;; It's intended to be minimalistic and non-invasive as you would expect
;; such simple functionality to be.

;; For more sophisticated features, like HTML tags or LaTeX environments
;; handling, consider https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens
