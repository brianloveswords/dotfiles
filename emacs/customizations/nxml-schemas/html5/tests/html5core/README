This directory contains tests for the RelaxNG (x)HTML 5 Core schema.
Simplified tests should be numbered and given a .html or .xhtml suffix.
Random files may also be introduced as regression tests: these
should also be numbered, but prefixed with an 'r'.

valid/
  Valid HTML 5 Core instances

invalid/
  Invalid HTML 5 Core instances /that are also not valid under other HTML 5 schemas/

Instances that are invalid HTML 5 Core but are valid under other HTML 5 schemas
go in their respective 'valid' directories: the HTML 5 Core test driver script
can import them as invalid.
